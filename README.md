## üéØ Key Objectives

This analysis aims to answer the following critical business questions:

1.  **Customer Behavior:** Who are our most valuable customers? What is the rate of customer churn, and what does the repeat purchase cycle look like?
2.  **Product & Sales Performance:** Which products, brands, and categories drive the most revenue? What are the peak sales periods (day of the week, time of day)? Which cities are the most profitable markets?
3.  **Operational Efficiency:** What is the success rate of various payment methods? Is there a significant bottleneck in our transaction process?
4.  **Logistics & Service Quality:** How do customers rate our delivery partners? Which partners are the most utilized and highest-rated?

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Microsoft Excel:** Utilized for initial data inspection, cleaning, and preliminary validation to ensure data integrity before analysis.
* **MySQL:** Served as the core engine for data analysis. Used for complex querying, joining disparate tables, and aggregating data to derive Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
* **Microsoft Power BI:** Employed as the visualization tool to build a dynamic, interactive dashboard that tells a compelling story and allows for easy exploration of the findings.

## üíæ The Dataset

The analysis is based on a structured relational dataset of approximately **15,000 records** distributed across six interconnected CSV files, simulating a real-world operational database.

* `Customer.csv`: Customer profiles (ID, name, location).
* `products.csv`: Product catalog (ID, name, category, brand, price).
* `order.csv`: Transactional order data (ID, customer ID, product ID, date, quantity).
* `transactions.csv`: Payment details for each order (ID, payment mode, status).
* `delivery.csv`: Information on delivery partners.
* `ratings.csv`: Customer ratings for products and delivery services associated with each order.
